                    <p>ScoreHub provides a centralised live score experience for sports fans and club/league admins alike. Fans can browse to the homepage, see the scores they want updating in real time, and be happy! Admin users can update the scores from the sideline of the game itself, and these updates are fed to the homepage.</p>

                    <p>If you would like your sport/league/team to be included, please get in touch by sending an email to admin at scorehub.info
